## Introduction
Bun is a custom checkboxes & radios CSS generator. It makes the task of creating pure CSS checkboxes and radios inputs much easier with CSS only instead of relying on images or SVG hacks which makes it provide more browser support and accessibility.

## Website
https://bun.js.org

## Features
1. Fully customizable CSS properties.
2. Images or SVGs free solution.
3. It allows you to add ripple CSS effects.
4. Dark and light preview background for flexible different color combination testing.
5. Generates checkboxes and radios CSS, unlike others generators that support checkboxes only.

## Browser Compatibility

### Tool browser support
Works on all modern browsers except IEs.

### Generated CSS browser support
Works on all modren browsers additional to IEs (Tested on IE 11).  
Safari, on the other hand, has accessibility issues but they are not caused by this package. It is caused by the system default settings. More information [here](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/25345#issuecomment-358364377).
